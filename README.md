Asymptotic notation
* Used when we drop coefficients and the less significant terms
* It concentrates on large values
* such as theta, omega notation

Big-O notation for asymptotic upper bounds
* it bounds the growth of the running time from above for large enough input sizes
* Big-O represents the best-case and worst-case scenario
* Big-theta bounds it from below and above
